\subsection{Deviations}
The process governing the creation of this protocol and report deviates from the
normal standard operating procedure.  This document combines both the protocol
and the report.  Normally the protocol is released first and report is released
after the protocol is executed.  This document represents an automated protocol
execution facilitated through the use of automation scripting and software.  The
review of a paper protocol and pre-approval of said protocol does not satisfy
the need to review the automated components used for the generation of this
document.  As a result, the automated components which codify the actual test
protocol are reviewed by a technical approver as this document and the
components are developed.  This technical approver is an approver of this
document and their approval indicates the automated components effectively test 
the article under test to meet the intended use as specified in the user 
requirements.  

Additionally data obtained from the execution of the protocol is collected and
presented in the grey boxes as objective evidence from the automated test
application.  Normally this would not be presented together with the protocol,
but given this is an automated process in a combined document; this is an
effective means of retaining and presenting the objective evidence for review
and approval.

Finally, presenting the protocol and the report together allows for a single
step automation process that can be easily maintained and re-executed. Re-execution
is often desired due to changes to the article under test or changes to user needs.
