\subsection{Tool Validation Test Approach}
This Test Plan describes a series of Test Suites, Test Cases, and Test Steps.
When executed, each Test Step determines if the Configuration Item satisfies one
or more software requirements.  When a Test Step indicates that the software
requirements are satisfied, the Test Step's result is "pass".  Otherwise, the
Test Step's result is "fail".  The computer records all "pass" and "fail"
results in the Test Plan record.  The Configuration Item is considered
verified when all Test Steps are executed and the Test Plan record contains
no "fail" results.  Each Test Step that results in a deviation, observation,
incident, or failure shall be represented in the final report.
