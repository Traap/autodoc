\subsection{Purpose}
This document summarizes the results of \gls{vss} \gls{dvva} performed as
defined by the \gls{dvmp}. Verification testing was focused on the individual
features and their behavior within \gls{vss} to confirm that the \gls{do} 
meets the \gls{di} requirements (System requirements, User Requirements,
Interface Specifications, UI Requirements, and Data Dictionary). This \gls{tr}
references objective evidence that the \glspl{tp} has been successfully executed,
and \gls{vss} is implemented correctly according to the requirements, design
specifications, and \gls{ucunuc}.
