The VSS application suite is a Class C device per IEC-62304:2006/AC:2008 and is
a Major Level of Concern per FDA/CDRH:2005.

The deliverables listed in Table 2 identify significant design inputs that
define the software product. As necessary, these deliverables will be updated as
development of the software product proceeds. For a comprehensive enumeration of
all design inputs for the software product, see the SOFTWARE DESIGN HISTORY FILE
in the Fenwal Document Control System.
