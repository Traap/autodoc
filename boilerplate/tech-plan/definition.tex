\textbf{NOTE:} As Vigilant Master Med (VMM) is a software only product, the VMM
SSR is written with sufficient detail to represent the Software
Requirement Specification for the purposes of Software Product Definition.  The
VSS Software of Unknown Provenance Requirements Specification covers
the gap between the VMM SSR and the standard Software Requirements
Specification.

The deliverables listed in Table 2 identify significant design inputs that
define the software product. As necessary, these deliverables will be updated as
development of the software product proceeds. For a comprehensive enumeration of
all design inputs for the software product, see the \gls{company} design history
file.

For Software Safety classification / Level of Concern, see \textit{VSS Risk Management Plan} in \gls{company} design history file.

\tlcVspace
Software will follow standards from \textit{Vigilant Software Suite Regulatory Assessment} in \gls{company} design history file.
