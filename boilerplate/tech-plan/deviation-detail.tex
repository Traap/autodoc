The \Gls{vss} Software Verification Plan deviates from the Software Verification
Procedure. Section 2.3 of the Software Verification Procedure states that the
project specific software verification plan must include `A list of SCRs to be
tested by software verification for the project'. This list is not directly
included in the \Gls{vss} Software Verification Plan. Instead, the \Gls{vss}
Software Verification Plan defines the process by which the final list of SCRs
to be tested is derived.
