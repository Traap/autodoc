\subsection{Strategy}
Software \gls{risk-control}s are mapped to software requirements. All software
requirements are verified with formal verification methods that use validated
simulators and the final products to conclude the product met its design input
requirements. A complete software risk analysis will be documented. See Master
Software Verification Plan for more details.
