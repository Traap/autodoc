\subsection{Build and Release}
There is a README.md in each repository that describes the subsystem \gls{build}
and release steps. Each subsystem has \gls{bamboo} plans and scripts within the
plan that are executed as part of continuous integration. The scripts/readme are
stored within the subsystem repositories and are also reviewed as part of pull
request process. If there is no \gls{bamboo} plan for a subsystem, then the
build/release procedure is documented in the SOFTWARE DESIGN HISTORY FILE.
