\subsection{Source Configuration Management Plan}

Atlassian Bitbucket is used for source code management, and is located at
\url{https://https://bitbucket.fkrnd.com/}. Atlassian Bitbucket is secured
through corporate single sign-on procedures. Source code repositories are
referenced as follows: project-name / repository-name.

In conjunction with the SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, the SOURCE CONFIGURATION
MANAGEMENT POLICY defines what and when configuration items are to be
controlled, the activities and tasks to be performed for configuration
management, personnel responsible for configuration management activities and
tasks, and the use of Change and Problem Tracking as part of configuration
management.

The branching model of source control in Bitbucket derives from the GitFlow
model.
