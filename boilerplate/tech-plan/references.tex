The software product will be developed per the Software DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
standard operating procedure. The standard operating procedure defines the
processes employed, activities and tasks to be performed, traceability to be
established, and deliverables to be completed for the software product.

\tlcVspace

The software product is the \Gls{vss} project, which is defined by the
\gls{changecontrol} reference. The \Gls{dhf} for the project is maintained in
the Document Control System under the Project \Gls{dhf}. For organizational
convenience a software product specific Software \Gls{dhf} is also maintained
within the Document Control System, and references Project \Gls{dhf} as its
master document. All deliverables for the software product managed through the
Document Control System will directly or indirectly reference the Software
\Gls{dhf}. As appropriate, additional packages may be defined for the software
product. Such packages will also directly or indirectly reference the Software
\Gls{dhf}.
