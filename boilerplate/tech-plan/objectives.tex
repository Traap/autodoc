\section{Software Product Objectives}
The purpose of this software product release is to create a VSS application
suite which is a set of Microsoft Windows and Web applications. \gls{vss} is a
combination of IT Connectivity Middleware and Infusion Management Applications
into one common product. It consists of several previously released
\gls{company} standalone infusion software items \gls{vssc}, \gls{vssi},
\gls{vssm}, \gls{vssb}, \gls{vsss}, and \gls{installer} all integrated into a
\gls{software-system} named \gls{vss}.

To achieve this objective the following outputs are expected from the software
development process:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A software architecture capable of supporting the designs required to
    meet the \gls{vss} product and subsystem requirements.
  \item A set of traceable software requirements specifications and software
    designs meeting the VSS product and subsystem requirements.
  \item A software FMEA tracing to the system FMEA and system requirements.
  \item Software controls implemented across the components defined in the
    software architecture tracing to the software FMEA and system FMEA.
  \item A \gls{soup} risk analysis.
  \item A traceable software verification plan, artifact set, and report.
  \item A \gls{vss} software development environment capable of developing and
    building the required software development process artifacts.
  \item A \gls{vss} software environment definition.
  \item A \gls{vss} software \gls{build} and release plan.
\end{itemize}
