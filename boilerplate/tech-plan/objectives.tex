\section{Software Product Objectives}
{The purpose of this software product release is to create a VSS application suite which is a set of Microsoft Windows-based web applications that provide reporting and Dose Error Reduction System configuration and distribution for infusion pumps.  

To achieve this objective the following outputs are expected from the software development process:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A software architecture capable of supporting the designs required to meet the VSS product and system requirements.
  \item A set of traceable software requirements specifications and software designs meeting the VSS product and system requirements.
  \item A software FMEA tracing to the system FMEA and system requirements.
  \item Software controls implemented across the components defined in the software architecture tracing to the software FMEA and system FMEA. 
  \item A software of unknown provenance risk analysis.
  \item A traceable software verification plan, artifact set, and report. 
  \item A VSS software development environment capable of developing and building the required software development process artifacts.
  \item A VSS software environment definition. 
  \item A VSS software build and release procedure.
\end{itemize}
