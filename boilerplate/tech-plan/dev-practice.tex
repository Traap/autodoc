\subsection{Development Practice}
The software development practices required the software developer to associate
their work with JIRA-issue. The software developer is required to develop and
informally unit test their work prior to committing their work to the common
code repository. This software development practice included safely refactoring
\gls{static-analysis} observations that violated Static Analysis Rules. 100\%
\gls{software-inspection} are done for all software developer changes.
