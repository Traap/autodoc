The software product is planned to have multiple releases from the software
development lifecycle and will be developed via the Evolutionary model.  

In conjunction with the SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, software configuration
items will conform to the CODING GUIDELINE. The BUILD PROCEDURE describes the
steps to perform to build the individual software systems that constitute the
software product. The RELEASE PROCEDURE defines the process for releasing the
software product, as well as the control of experimental articles generated by a
software product release.

In conjunction with the SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, DOCUMENT NAMING CONVENTION
identifies the purpose, audience, responsibilities for development, naming
conventions, and required approvers for documents created during the development
of the software product. 

In conjunction with the SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, the CHANGE CONTROL
REFERENCE identifies plans for the activities and tasks, deliverables, and
responsible personnel for software risk management, including the management of
risks associated with software of unknown provenance.
