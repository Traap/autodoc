\subsection{SOUP}
In the \gls{vss}, numerous software components utilize the \gls{soup} to perform
their designed function.  Analysis of system design is performed in the
construction of this plan and a representative set of product systems
requirements which utilize the SOUP is chosen.  This chosen set of product
system requirements is tested in the normal course of design verification and
design validation.  The successful testing of these product requirements infers
that the SOUP requirements are successfully validated.
