\subsection{Reports}
Software \gls{testing-unit}, \gls{static-analysis} and \gls{software-inspection}
are performed as part of continuous integration. When nearing a final validation
release candidate, formal reports will be created and stored in quality system.
Prior to design transfer, all software verification reports must be complete and
in documentation system prior to design review and will be reviewed as part of
the software design review.
