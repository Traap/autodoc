\subsection{Configuration Management}
When a Configuration Item is changed by its manufacturer or by a Company,
a Company will review the manufacturer's release notes or a Company's design
history file to determine if regression testing or adjustment to this Report
Package is necessary, and re-run the Report Package to confirm the
manufacturer's changes or a Company's changes do not impact product operation,
product quality, or quality decisions made before upgrading to a new release of
the Configuration Item.
