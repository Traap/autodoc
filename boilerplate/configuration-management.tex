\subsection{Configuration Management}
When a Configuration Item is changed, we will review the manufacturer's release
notes or our \Gls{dhf} (DHF) to determine if regression testing or
adjustments to this Report Package is necessary. We will verify the changes do
not impact product operation, product quality, or quality decision made prior
to performing the upgrade.
