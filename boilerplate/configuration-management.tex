\subsection{Configuration Management}
When a Configuration Item is changed by its manufacturer or by adCompany, adCompany will
review the manufacturer's release notes or adCompany's design history file to
determine if regression testing or adjustment to this Protocol Package is
necessary, and re-run the Protocol Package to confirm the manufacturer's changes
or adCompany's changes do not impact product operation, product quality, or quality
decisions made before upgrading to a new release of the Configuration Item.
