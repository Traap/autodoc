\subsection{Unit Test Approach}
The Protocol Package describes a series of protocols and test steps.  When
executed, each test step determines if the Configuration Item satisfies one or
more intended use requirements.  When a test step indicates that its
intended use requirements are satisfied, the test step's result is "pass".
Otherwise, the test step's result is "fail".  The computer records all "pass"
and "fail" results in the test protocol record.  The Configuration Item is
considered validated when all test steps are executed and the test protocol
record contains no "fail" results.  Each test step that results in a deviation,
observation, incident, or failure shall be represented in the final report.
