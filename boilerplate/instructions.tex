\subsection{Test Protocol Instructions}
This Protocol Package describes Test Protocols and Test Steps that demonstrate
how the Configuration Item satisfies the IUR.  Each Test Protocol describes any
setup criteria needed to conduct the Test Steps. Each Test Protocol contains a
list of IUR and the Test Steps that demonstrate how the Configuration Item
satisfies the IUR. Each Test Step is marked passed or failed as it is completed.
Each Test Protocol is marked passed when all Test Steps pass or failed if a
single Test Step fails.  This serves as a record of completed Test Protocols and
Test Steps.

Test Protocols are automatically run by the computer generating a report in PDF
format.  Test Protocols are code-reviewed prior to use using the same
code-review practice that is used for the medical device software.  Test
Protocols are stored in the Configuration Management tool that is used by the
medical device software.  Test Steps that fail during computer execution or
observations made during EDMQ document routing, result in JIRA tickets being
created to address the issue.  This results in another execution of the Protocol
Package and document routing.

When it becomes necessary to annotate a computer generated document, adCompany's
documentation practices must be followed.  The documentation practices are
summarized below:

\begin{enumerate}
\item When necessary to write down test values, they are written using
an ink pen.
\item Any cross-outs of results or modifications to any test step shall be initialed and dated.
\item All appropriate blanks shall be filled in or annotated as ``N/A'' (not applicable).
\item No whiteout or other text-obscuring technique is to be used.
\item Any annotation must be signed and dated.
\end{enumerate}

In most cases, a Test Protocol is to be judged as "fail" if any Test Step within
that Test Protocol fails. If the failed Test Step does not impact proper
evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of the device, the Test Protocol in
which the Test Step failed may be judged "pass".  For such failed Test Steps a
rationale will be noted in the comments section and in the final Protocol
Package.  If a failed Test Protocol is re-executed a record of the failed
results are included with the Test Protocol when it passes and attached to the
Protocol Package.  If a Protocol Package is re-executed a new report is
created and routed for approval in EDM Quality.

\subsection{Test Protocol Storage and Review}
This Protocol Package is part of adCompany's automated validation framework.  The
framework consists of following parts:
\begin{description}
  \item[\LaTeX] files are used to provide an Abstract, Introduction, Intended
    Use Requirements, Test Protocol Overview, Test Equipment, Configuration
    Item Validation, Conclusion, and Change Summary.

  \item[Haskell] software is used to run the automated framework to collect test
    evidence.

  \item[Bitbucket] (https://stash.amgencss.fpcomplete.com/projects) is used as
    the storage repository for \LaTeX \& Haskell files.

  \item[Stash] (https://stash.amgencss.fpcomplete.com/projects) is used to
    create a pull-request to review the \LaTeX \& Haskell files prior to use.

  \item[Evidence] Protocol Package output includes one or more Protocols.  Each
    protocol has Test Steps, Test Scripts and Test Evidence.
