\textbf{NOTE:} As Vigilant Master Med (VMM) is a software only product, the VMM
SyRS (\vssmSyRS) is written with sufficient detail to represent the Software
Requirement Specification for the purposes of Software Product Definition.  The
VSS Software of Unknown Provenance Requirements Specification (\vssSOUP) covers
the gap between the VMM SyRS and the standard Software Requirements
Specification.
