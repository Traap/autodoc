\textbf{NOTE:} As Vigilant Master Med (VMM) is a software only product, the VMM
SSR is written with sufficient detail to represent the Software
Requirement Specification for the purposes of Software Product Definition.  The
VSS Software of Unknown Provenance Requirements Specification covers
the gap between the VMM SSR and the standard Software Requirements
Specification.
