The VSS Software Verification Plan (696-PLN-059132[A]) deviates from the
Software Verification Procedure (SOP-PRC02010[D]). Section 2.3 of the Software
Verification Procedure states that the project specific software verification
plan must include "A list of SCRs to be tested by software verification for the
project". This list is not directly included in the VSS Software Verification
Plan. Instead, the VSS Software Verification Plan defines the process by which
the final list of SCRs to be tested is derived.
